Title: Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeatures Challenge Evaluation

Dataset:
ASVspoof2019

[Details about dataset]
    # of speakers = Male 8, Female 12 for both of training and developing set
    # of training set = 25,380(genuine 2,580 spoof 22,800)
    # of development set = 24,986(genuine 2,548 spoof 22,296)
    
[Details about speech]
    The duration of speech = 1~2sec.
    Sampling freq = 16kHz
    Bit depth = 16bits
    
Last week:
1. Implementation of LFCC from scratch
2. Studying of how CQCC work, what is different from MFCC, LFCC

This week:
1. Take a look at dataset format, protocol files
2. Make a class of ASVspoofDataset(derived from torch.utils.data.Dataset)

Next week:
1. Make a class for pre-processing .flac files(Do I have to format length of speech?)
2. Calculate EER of LFCC-GMM model
(3. Experiment on hyperparameter of LFCC and GMM)
